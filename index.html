      While cleaning out your grandmother's attic, you hear the faint soumd of a
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4enYB8IwwE" target="_blank">
        ticking
      </a>
      clock. After rummaging around, you find the source - an ornate jewelry
      box. Upon opening the box, you discover a dusty pocket watch. You pick it
      up and are instantly transported to a time you do not recognize.
